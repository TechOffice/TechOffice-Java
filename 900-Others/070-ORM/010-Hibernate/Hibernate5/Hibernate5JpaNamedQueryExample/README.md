# JPA Named Query Example
In JPA, the query can be placed in Annotation and also XML. In this example, the query would be placed in the xml files. Then the querys would be reused. Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) would be used for Named Query. If Native Query is preferred, Named Native Query would be used instead.
