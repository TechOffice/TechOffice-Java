# Context and Dependency Injection

Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) allow the container to create and destory instances of beans, inject them into other beans, using EL expressions, specialize them with qualifier annotations, add interceptors and decorator s to them, without modifying existing code.

## Implementation
* JBoss Weld

## What is a Bean
It is an object managed by a container.
